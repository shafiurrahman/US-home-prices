# US-home-prices

Describe and explain *all* the factors that could influence residential home prices across the United States over the next 10 years, and how.

The following factors will affect the residential home prices in U.S. in the next ten years

1)	HOME CHARACTERISTICS
1.1)	 Age of home:  
The price of the home will be affected by the age of the home. A new built house will cost more than the older house. Reason being older house require renovation, plumbing or electrical repairs etc.
How it will impact future sales:
Buyers for new homes accounted for 13% of total sales and older homes accounted for 87%.
35% of buyers for newer homes bought were in the age group 65-95 yrs. This trend will continue as the older people are less likely in giving time and energy for renovation, plumbing , electrical etc as it will be stressful at times to do this.

1.2)	 Type of homes:
Still the most common type of homes purchased are detached single-family home which also account for 83% of total sales.
People buy it for convenience and privacy . but nowadays under attack for not being environment friendly.
Homes of the future will increasingly tap into neighbourhood energy systems, feature flexible layouts and use improved technology to make automatic decisions about heating, security and even postal deliveries, according to a new report.
Another reason is because of aging population
inspired by the need for more urban housing in already densely populated areas, future design will produce homes with smaller footprints, but with more storeys, using balcony and roof space to provide outdoor space. 

So the contribution of single family homes is likely to come down . 

1.3)	 Commuting distance or location preference:
Homes in urban localities where you find offices tend to be more , than nearby towns. People prefer near by commute to work to avoid wastage of time in travelling.

Retired professionals due to reduced income tend to prefer locations away from the cities.
	
1.4)	 Size of the home:
The price of the house will also be affected by size . Bigger houses in urban or sub-urban areas will cost more due to increase in production cost as well space occupied.
These phenomena have not changed and is likely to continue.

1.5)	 Heating and cooling Cost:
One of The most important recurring cost will be heating and cooling cost. Based on the climate of the region it becomes important.






2)	Eonomy:
2.1) interest rates:
Credit crunch in the market will bring down the prices of homes where as easy availability of credit will eventually increase the price of the homes.
Nearly 86% of home sales is done through financing. 
Down payment amount also will become a barrier if higher amount of down payment is required to purchase a property due to credit crunch this will affect the prices of the home,as it will bring down demand.


2.2) demand for housing:
Demand for housing will increase as the income of the buyers increase. If there is consistent increase in buyers income over the years ,savings for down payment increases this will increase the demand. As the demand , increases so will the price depending on availability of homes.

2.3) Unemployment:
If the market is going through depression , unemployment will be high, this will affect the sales of homes .prices of home will be down and defaults will be high. Foreclosures will be high too.

2.4) Manufacturing activity:
 
If manufacturing activitiy is started at a new location, demand for housing will be generated, there by increasing the price of the homes in that location.

2.5) Foreclosures:
Increase in the foreclosures will not only hurt an individual owner but it will also depress property values, this will have adverse effect on home prices.
Further those home owners whose loans are foreclosed will loose access  to lower interest rates which will cause to reduce expenditure in other areas.

	













3)	Government Policies:
3.1) local govt policy:
Local government has the most influence on real estate markets. It affects the supply and cost of real estate through zoning and land use regulations, fees on new land development, and restrictive building codes. It also affects rental rates through the assessment of property taxes.



3.2) fiscal policy and monetary policies:
Taxes , monetary policies will affect almost all the sectors directly and indirectly . they will further affect the prices of homes both directly and indirectly as well.

3.3) National laws:
USA has several laws that affected the housing market earlier too like National housing Act 1934, United States housing act 1937 , G.I.Bill 1944 and other subsequent acts.
the history of housing policy in the United States includes great achievements that helped millions find affordable housing and improve their dwellings, but it also includes a troubled legacy of racism and inequality that prevented millions more from benefiting from government programs. In many cases, racism and segregation were explicitly enshrined in law, and at other times they were merely accepted practice in implementing the law.

The prices of the homes will be affected by national laws as well.

3.4) Taxes:
Tax rebates on principal repayment , interest repayment will further help people in going for own houses which will drive the demand , hence prices of the houses will increase when more and more people go for own housing .
